		<h1> Peyton Tamara and her pineapples </h1>
		<h2> heya everybody! </h2> 
		<p> I love art of all kinds </p>
		<p> Playing and writing music is my favorite type of art </p>
		<p> Someday i would like to go into art but I've been told it is very hard to succeed in art so Ive been thinking about going into coding or couseling </p>
		<p> So I made this website to learn about html </p>
		<p> I like the band glass animals a lot </p>
		<p> One of my friends called me pineapple once and it stuck </p>
		<p> I've been pineapple ever since </p>
		<p> "We all have those fears that control us. The strongest people are the ones that don't just learn to live with them. </p>
		<p> They learn to make the fear work for them." </p>
		<h5> I am still very confused about how all of this works but i am starting to get the hang of it </h5>
