		<p> I love art of all kinds </p>
		<p> Playing and writing music is my favorite type of art </p>
		<p> Someday i would like to go into art for my job but I've been told it is very hard to succeed in art so Ive been thinking about going into coding or couseling </p>
		<p> So I made this website to learn about html </p>
		<p> I like the band glass animals a lot </p>
		<p> One of my friends called me pineapple once and it stuck </p>
		<p> I've been pineapple ever since </p>
		<p> "We all have those fears that control us. The strongest people are the ones that don't just learn to live with them. </p>
		<p> They learn to make the fear work for them." </p>
		<h5> I am still very confused about how all of this works but i am starting to get the hang of it </h5>
